# Infinitum Primum

Infinitum Primum is my 2023 music writing project. Every day I will write one snaredrum solo practice Etude so that at the end of the year I will end up with my own huge practice book. The name 'Infinitum Primum' comes from latin and means 'The first infinity' since its my first music book and it contains a (hyperbolic) infinite amount of practice material
